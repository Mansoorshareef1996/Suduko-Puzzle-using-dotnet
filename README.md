# Suduko-Puzzle-using-dotnet

The premise of this project is simple: a Sudoku puzzle game.We're going to focus on the use of Focus, drawing graphics, timers, and fluid UI design, in order  to: 
1. Pull up an unsolved puzzle... 
2. From a selection of varying difficulities...
3. The ability for us to save our current progress, to be resumed later...
4. With a mechanism to track our progress with solving puzzles within a single difficulty...
5. A button to "cheat" or "help" with finding the solution...
6. Another button to verify the correctness (or lack thereof) of our current solution...
7. A "pause" button...
8. And of course, as with most things, a reset button.
